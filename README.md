"# ebay-alerts" 

Create automatic email notifications for eBay searches. This application is very much in-progress and limited search criteria and customization is available, but my hope is to turn this into a very simple and very clean but very powerful interface for advanced eBay users to manage their alerts.

Currently, users can create accounts and once logged in can create and manage new alerts at a user dashboard. At the dashboard, users can save a string of keywords and a timer job will run the search and mail a formatted list of results to the email associated with the account.
